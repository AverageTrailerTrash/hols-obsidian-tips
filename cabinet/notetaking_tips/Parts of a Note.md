# Parts of a Note

You'll hear some commonly used phrases in this vault, like head/header, body, and footer.

## Header

When I say header, I'm normally referring to the official [[Note Header]].

However, you may also choose to add more information *after* that section but *before* the main body of the note. 

The header can be great for things like quick navigational links you may need when visiting the note. Just keep in mind that whatever you add here you'll have to scroll through. To deal with that, I tend to nest my bulkier lists of navigational links using [[Index Headers]] (a list of separate [[Index Files]]).

I'll also have an `Associated Notes` section, where I just drop links that seem relevant to the note or that I often need to get to from it. This is very much a living section that gets updated with use. I try to include links to content that is 

## Body

The body of a note is the main text of it. 

You can have anything you want here.

## Footer

The footer is just an area where you keep "post-note" information.

For example, I like to keep a `# Change Log` section in my footer to keep track of any major modifications made to the note.

The footer is best for "good to know" information that may not always be "need to know." Things that are nice to have but that you don't want to scroll through if you don't have to.

The footer is also a good place to put things like fancy JavaScript stuff that modifies the rest of the page but doesn't output anything at its own location. Again, nice to have, but you don't want to scroll past it when trying to take notes down.
