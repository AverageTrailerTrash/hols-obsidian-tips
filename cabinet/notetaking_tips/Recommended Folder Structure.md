# Recommended Folder Structure

>[!x] This vault has a slightly different structure, as it is for public consumption and about (mostly) one topic. More involved vaults call for more thorough and consistent organization.

I use a simple folder structure in most of my vaults, as well as on my computers.

At the top level we have: `utilities`, `cabinet`, `binder`, `worktable`, `inbox`, and `outbox`.

`utilities` holds any meta information needed to operate the vault, like its `templates` or custom `scripts`. I'll also store notes that mostly serve to describe other notes here, like indexes that link to lots of other notes, intermediary relationship files, or attribute files that extend the metedata of another file.

`cabinet` holds any notes that are organized into strict categories. I typically store my files into folders that match their category, and give them an ID that includes the slug (unique identifier) of the category itself. So this section is much stricter, in some ways, but also produces the most useful and organized notes. As more categories are added, I will group these categories under parent folders to keep things easy to navigate. 

The end goal is to build up enough categories and infrastructure around them to be able to comfortably use `cabinet` directly for almost everything.

`binder` holds any notes that need to be dealt with sequentially and may be temporary, and do not have an existing category. It's great for things like notes on a particular class or writing project. These generally aren't atomic. Whole binders may be discarded when a class or project is done; permanent files should be move to `cabinet`.

`worktable` holds different workspaces for content that is very specific to a certain project or activity. They often hold duplicative content from cabinet,   I have a similar folder outside my vault, as well, that all of my "working" files go in, like the source and quick notes on a video editing project. This is a little more structured than `binder`.

`inbox` holds content coming into the vault, like copies of articles I want to take notes on or emails I need to respond to. While `outbox` holds content leaving the vault, like exported pdfs and emails I need to send. Ideally, original copies of vital files would never be put in either of these folders, so you can safely clear them out when clutter builds up.
