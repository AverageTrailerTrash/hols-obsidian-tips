# Relationship Files

A relationship file is an intermediary file that describes the relationship between two (or more, but preferably two) other notes or the elements they represent. 

A relationship file gives you one place to put this information in a way that both removes clutter from the involved notes and avoids duplicative information. *See: [[The Danger of Duplicative Information]]*

The easiest and most literal example of a relationship file would be one that describes the relationship of two fictional characters or real people in your life. But a relationship can be anything that demonstrates a connection between two elements.

For example, you may be taking notes on your local history, and have a note on a particular flour mill. It may be worth denoting the influence that flour mill had on various other people and places in town. 

Maybe there was a relationship between the fourth mayor and the flour mill, where he was invoved in some scandal with it and was kicked out of his position as a result. Maybe there was a relationship between the farm next to the flour mill and the mill due to some territory dispute, a marriage between the families, a fire, and later a buyout that lead to one company owning both.

Relationship files are a helpful "catch-all" for these types of things, when a separate note on just the event would be too broad to properly communicate the way these two particular things were affected by each other in such situations over time.

The fire at the mill and farm may have had far-reaching consequences throughout the town, for example, and those may overshadow the subtleties of these two participants in a note about the event itself.

## Dealing with Relationship Hell

When you really get into using them, you may find relationships everywhere. And for most use cases, that is a great thing. It suggests you have a strong understanding of your subject or very fleshed-out creative ideas.

But how do you deal with them? How can you sanely navigate the relationships associated with each note? 

This is where [[Index Files]] and [[Index Headers]] can be a big help. It was my need to sanely manage relationships that lead to them coming about in the first place.

The way I handle it is that:

* My main note template puts index headers in every file I make automatically.
* My relationship template prompts me to select the related files and fills in some metadata that points back to them.
* My relationship index template generates an index file with a Dataview table showing any relationships related to a note. 
 
The only manual labor I need to do to get a "List of x's Relationships" link in any note is hitting a hotkey. Now whenever I add a relationship for that note, their relationship index will be updated.

Of course, you can just build your notes with a relationships Dataview table built-in. But I try to minimize how much scrolling I need to do to get to the meat-and-potatoes of the note.
