# The Danger of Duplicative Information

Duplicative or redundant information is information that is repeated in multiple areas of the vault, or even between the vault and other organizational tools you have.

One major power of tools with rapid cross-reference systems like Obsidian is that you can have a "single source of truth" for even the most minute facts and details, without that in any way slowing down your ability to access that information. A link is instant.

But why is duplicative information a problem in the first place?

Primarily, it's because something can be updated in one place but not another.

Imagine you have an outline for a school essay you need to write:

* You write it on paper, and also put it in your vault. 
* Later on, you realize you misread something in the rules and update your written outline, but forget to update your digital one. 
 
If you then make your essay based on the digital one, you end up handing in an essay that you already knew wouldn't fulfill the assignment's requirements.

The same thing can happen with general knowledge references. Maybe you mistype a formula and edit it, but don't realize you'd duplicated that formula in many other places, and end up studying or referencing an incorrect version later.

To avoid situations like this in Obsidian, we have two options:

* **Extract any information that gets duplicated into its own note.** This lets you reference the information easily in any system that supports links, as you would just link to the extracted note wherever it is relevant. 
* **Embed any information that gets duplicated from one note into another.** Obsidian lets you embed blocks and sections, so you can ensure all of your later discussions are referencing, say, the same paragraph. This is a little messier and harder to scale to other apps.

I obviously recommend extracting over embedding, and mostly present methods built around that approach. It has various benefits:

* You can categorize this kind of common content and build more infrastructure around it, like having special templates for special [[Relationship Files|relationship]] types.
* If you decide to split up your vault, you can still reference these files via unbreaking links with something like AdvancedURI, while you cannot embed something across vaults.  

But if you don't mind a messier interweaving of information, the embedding approach is faster and more accessible when you're first getting started.

Either case requires that you search for new information you add to see if it was previously discussed. Obsidian makes this relative easy with its Quick Switcher (`CTRL`+`O` by default) and its integrated search tools. There are plugins that allow you to pop-out the search tools more like the Quick Switcher menu as well.

## But isn't it good to rewrite things sometimes?

It is! It's fantastic when studying to re-explain things from scratch and work without direct access to your notes.

It's just that, when you're building a permanent reference system, you need to make a clear distinction between content that *is* and *is not* intended to be a "single source of truth." You need to understand, at a glance:

* what is temporary or opinionated, and 
* what is actual reference information.

Likewise, it's often good to have a **multi-step system** where something goes through multiple iterations, such as an essay outline. 

But if you're going to keep the previous versions, you need to make it clear when they have been moved to the next phase in some other format.

>[!note] For example, I stamp my physical pen-and-paper notes when their ideas have been moved over to another format. This reminds me that they are redundant and shouldn't have more information added to them. Instead, I should start a new notebook page to discuss any new ideas I have.

A becomes B, B becomes C, C becomes D.... and that's that. You don't go back to change B when D is already in the works. Either D is what you update, or you make some new temporary material that will eventually be moved to D in your system.
