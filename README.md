# Hol's Obsidian Tips

This is a vault with some of my personal [Obsidian MD](http://www.obsidian.md/) tips. It's not official in any way.

# Things to Know

* This is a recent WIP, so don't expect much yet.
* Some meta functionality in this vault requires the Dataview plugin (not included).
* This is more of a wiki / text dump, rather than a guided course.
* If you're struggling with eyestrain from the default theme, I recommend Minimal w/ the contrast set to True Black in the Minimal Theme Settings plugin.
