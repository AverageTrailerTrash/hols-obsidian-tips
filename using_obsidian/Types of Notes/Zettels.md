# Zettels
#unfleshed 

A zettel is a brief thought, essentially. A hyper-atomic piece of information. 

> [!note] Background Information
> The word comes from Zettelkasten ("slip-card box"), which was a traditional notetaking system where chunks of information were written on slip-cards (large index cards) with cross-references to each other.
> 
> As the concept of the Zettelkasten came into the digital era and tools like Obsidian came about, the zettel seemed to shrink from a full slip-card with possibly several paragraphs to smaller and smaller nuggets of information. 
> 
> Unlike in a traditional system, there is no time wasted when going from card to card in Obsidian -- it's just a link. You're there instantly. So you don't need to be as reserved about how frequently you move from note to note.
