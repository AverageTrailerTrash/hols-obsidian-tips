# Essay Files

Essay files are your writings on subjects that interest you, such as your attempts at explaining a workflow. While these can be kept private, they're generally written in a way that expects some kind of audience.  Most of the notes in this vault are considered essays in my system.

Essays don't have to be a certain length. But I find they're most useful to me if they're something I can write between an hour^[I type fast...] and a few days. Essays are not just a way of working out your thoughts but also a way of developing modular content.

There are some Obsidian users that will take text modularity to the extreme, and never even rephrase the same idea twice in social media posts or chatrooms, copy/pasting parts of their vault to frankenstein together human communication. I think this is an affront to language, but you do you.

In any case, it's not entirely the point of essays to be a DRY (i.e. "do not repeat" yourself) form of writing. I strongly encourage writing multiple essays on the same content. 

Especially if you're studying, this kind of "reinventing" things from scratch is *really* helpful to force recall. 

>[!rant] Seeing a reminder of something is not the same as recalling it.
> Using past notes to remember something creates new memories around that thing instead of connecting the original memory to even more points, which negatively impacts your ability to recall concepts later. 
> 
> It's the same reason you should never flip flashcards when you don't immediately remember the answer, but rather do the work brainstorming on paper to try and recall the answer. 
> 
> Getting the answer given to you again doesn't do anything beneficial for your memory and goes against the whole idea of spaced repetition.

Certainly, DRY is a good practice when you're making permanent notes for your own reference. But essays are a little different. They're time capsules of your understanding of something, your opinion on something, your beliefs in something. 

Certainly, they *can* be breathing things that get modified or slowly built up over time. 

My point is just that they're separate entities from any old block of text in the vault.

They are modular in how they can be scavenged from or used wholesale to produce things like public talks and blog posts, or combined into things like courses and books. Because they are a bit more polished than typical notes, you have the freedom to do more outside the vault with them.
